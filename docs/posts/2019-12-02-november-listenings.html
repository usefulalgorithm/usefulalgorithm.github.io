<p>What is this… IDM with dissonant jazz samples? Free jazztronica? Deconstructed glitch jazz?</p>

<p><img src="https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1356483119_10.jpg" /></p>
<p>Experimental indie art pop. The instrumentals are very techno-ish and has a bunch of four-on-the-floor beats going on, while Jenny Hval’s voice is as ethereal as ever. Do not miss out.</p>

<p>I’m a sucker for Japanese ambient new age music… This is like the background music for Legend of Zelda games, but without the actual game distracting you from really getting absorbed by the music.</p>

<p><img src="https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/622025/large/Cover.jpg" /></p>
<p>Haven’t listened to Andy Stott’s stuff in a long time… Slow, dark, twisted techno / house music. 0L9, Take, Versi and Dismantle are great tracks.</p>
<p>Release date: 2019-11-08</p>

<p>Not as magnificent as Aesthethica, but still kicks ass. The band kind of returns to a more black metal inspired sound on this album. Some songs have weird, almost funny metal parts where the guitars play syncopated chugs and the drums just blast away, and it’s these parts that kind of worries me if the day when djent black metal becomes a legit subgenre has finally come. Other than that I think most of the other heavier metal sections are carried out wonderfully, like the song God of Love - it’s gotta be one of my favorite metal jams in 2019. I also enjoy the more mellowed out, modern classical-ish interludes on this album.</p>
<p>Release date: 2019-11-12</p>

<h2 id="a-winged-victory-for-the-sullen---the-undivided-five">A Winged Victory For The Sullen - The Undivided Five</h2>
<p><img src="https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3702110673_10.jpg" /></p>
<p>Very soothing piano neoclassical / ambient. Great to put on repeat on a sleep deprived workday…</p>

<p><img src="https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0485761639_10.jpg" /></p>
<p>Ass-kicking death metal. Actually pretty catchy. That last track is pretty post-metal-ish and super epic. Dig it!</p>

<h2 id="drab-majesty---modern-mirror">Drab Majesty - Modern Mirror</h2>
<p><img src="https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a4190738787_10.jpg" /></p>
<p>Has the moment when dark, gothic, Cabaret Voltaire inspired post-punk bands become once again championed by music dorkish reviewers on the Internet, i.e. yours truly, since forever finally arrived? Probably. I like this a lot more than I like the Strokes, the National and the Horror, or all these post-punk revival bands combined.</p>
<p>Release date: 2019-07-12</p>

<p><img src="https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3615695996_10.jpg" /></p>
<p>A pretty banger techno album. Bandcamp introduction says Luke Slater is “an innovator of psychedelic mindfuck techno”. Quite fitting IMO.</p>

<h2 id="jessica-pratt---quiet-signs">Jessica Pratt - Quiet Signs</h2>
<p><img src="https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3502216320_10.jpg" /></p>
<p>Short and sweet folk album. Jessica Pratt has an interesting voice. I enjoy the stripped-down production on this album.</p>
<p>Release date: 2019-02-08</p>
<p>[8.0/10]</p>
<h2 id="tune-of-negation-shackleton---reach-the-endless-sea">Tune Of Negation, Shackleton - Reach The Endless Sea</h2>
<p><img src="https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3119923355_10.jpg" /></p>
<p>I’m not familiar with Shackleton’s earlier stuff… I thought he was known to be doing dark dubstep inspired electronica? Anyway this album is very vibrant and organic. I like how there are a lot of acoustic instruments featured on this album, the kalimbas, organs and vibraphones are very prominent and contribute a lot to the overall organic feel of this project. Also I suspect the Japanese ambient scene has a pretty deep influence on this album.</p>
<p>Release date: 2019-10-18</p>

<h2 id="hand-habits---placeholder">Hand Habits - Placeholder</h2>
<p><img src="https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2333065947_10.jpg" /></p>
<p>Pretty rockin’ indie rock. The guitar solos on this album kick a lot of asses.</p>
<p>Release date: 2019-03-01</p>
<p>[7.9/10]</p>
<h2 id="debby-friday---death-drive">DEBBY FRIDAY - DEATH DRIVE</h2>
<p><img src="https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1633806476_10.jpg" /></p>
<p>Short and powerful industrial experimental hip hop (can’t think of a better description… think clipping. and Chino Amobi and the likes).</p>
<p>Release date: 2020-05-22</p>
<p>[7.9/10]</p>
<h2 id="young-marco---bahasa">Young Marco - Bahasa</h2>
<p><img src="https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0636059926_10.jpg" /></p>
<p>Intriguing ambient techno with heavy Bali references. Sounds somewhere between meditative and festive.</p>
<p>Release date: 2019-07-12</p>
<p>[7.9/10]</p>
<h2 id="cate-le-bon---reward">Cate Le Bon - Reward</h2>
<p><img src="https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1051581971_10.jpg" /></p>
<p>Art indie pop. There are moments where it sounds very similar to Stereolab’s stuff, but not as lush.</p>
<p>Release date: 2019-05-24</p>
<p>[7.8/10]</p>
<h2 id="e-saggila---my-world-my-way">E-Saggila - My World My Way</h2>
<p><img src="https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3544291921_10.jpg" /></p>
<p>Fast and hard industrial techno. Pretty gnarly.</p>
<p>Release date:</p>
<p>[7.8/10]</p>
<h2 id="not-waving-dark-mark---downwelling">Not Waving, Dark Mark - Downwelling</h2>
<p><img src="https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3502216320_10.jpg" /></p>
<p>I dig this way more than I dig Mark Lanegan’s own stuff. Mark’s voice has a raw, carefree quality to it, yet when paired with the restrained instrumentals from Not Waving it makes a bizarrely compelling combination. The last song is very good.</p>
<p>Release date: 2019-08-02</p>
<p>[7.8/10]</p>
<h2 id="lapalux---amnioverse">Lapalux - Amnioverse</h2>
<p><img src="https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0924488326_10.jpg" /></p>
<p>Pretty decent IDM record. Not too challenging or groundbreaking, but does everything quite well, a well-balanced album. Some of the ambient parts of this record are pretty post-rock like, but they don’t overindulge like the run-of-the-mill post rock bands do. I like the track Thin Air a lot. JFDR’s solo album from 2017 is dope too.</p>
<p>Release date: 2019-11-08</p>
<p>[7.8/10]</p>
<h2 id="swans---leaving-meaning.">Swans - leaving meaning.</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0397/1609/products/chipboard_YG63_grande.jpg?v=1571438771" /></p>
<p>The music sounds pretty much like reiterations and / or continuations of Swans’ previous albums. There are indeed interesting moments on this album, like tracks Sunfucker and Annaline, but all in all there really isn’t a departure from the Michael Gira sound in the older albums, despite a whole new lineup of massively talented musicians.</p>
<p>Release date: 2019-10-25</p>
<p>[7.7/10]</p>
<h2 id="kim-gordon---no-home-record">Kim Gordon - No Home Record</h2>
<p><img src="https://store.matadorrecords.com/media/catalog/product/cache/4/image/500x/85e4522595efc69f496374d01ef2bf13/k/i/kimgordon_nohomerecord.jpg" /></p>
<p>Kim Gordon tries trap rap… and succeeds. Abrasive. There are still some indie rock tracks on this album, and although they’re not really as experimental as, say, Sonic Youth’s stuff that are laden with insane guitar tunings and absurd song structures, they do hold their own and are pretty enjoyable.</p>
<p>Release date: 2019-10-11</p>
<p>[7.7/10]</p>
<h2 id="devendra-banhart---ma">Devendra Banhart - Ma</h2>
<p><img src="https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2002100258_10.jpg" /></p>
<p>Though I still prefer Mala to this album, it doesn’t mean this album is not good or anything. Devendra Banhart has a great voice and a good grasp of writing songs that are fun and catchy. Warm and loving indie folk. And the Vashti Bunyan featured track is awesome.</p>
<p>Release date: 2020-02-21</p>

<h2 id="michael-vincent-waller---moments">Michael Vincent Waller - Moments</h2>
<p><img src="https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3154283276_10.jpg" /></p>
<p>Sentimental piano music. The Nocturnes and Love suite are highlights on this album.</p>
<p>Release date: 2021-06-11</p>

<h2 id="project-pablo---sofware">Project Pablo - Sofware</h2>
<p><img src="https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0940380732_10.jpg" /></p>

<p><img src="https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0117975417_10.jpg" /></p>
<p>Interesting modern classical solo cello album. Some songs sound pretty bluesy.</p>

<h2 id="kindohm---meme-booth">Kindohm - Meme Booth</h2>
<p><img src="https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/620495/large/CON027.jpg" /></p>
<p>Futuristic glitchy techno / dance. Dude used TidalCycle to make this album, so that’s pretty cool.</p>

<p><img src="https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2148205070_10.jpg" /></p>
<p>Pretty cool deconstructed techno music. The songs are very sparse and can sometimes feel a bit too random.</p>

<h2 id="various-artists---cairo-concepts">Various Artists - Cairo Concepts</h2>
<p><img src="https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2829425510_10.jpg" /></p>
<p>Intriguing Egyptian dance music compilation. Mahraganat it is called, I’d say it’s Arabic grime / dance music. Not really a fan of this type of music though.</p>
<p>Release date:</p>
<p>[7.1/10]</p>
<h2 id="fly-pan-am---cest-ça">Fly Pan Am - C’est ça</h2>
<p><img src="https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2782215947_10.jpg" /></p>
<p>Mellow Deafheaven… or black metal inspired vocals and drums on tripping post-rock-ish instrumentals and droning synths. Check the last song and don’t tell me you haven’t heard this beat on some other black metal albums.</p>
<p>Release date: 2017-07-25</p>
<p>[7.0/10]</p>

<p><img src="https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3800203582_10.jpg" /></p>
<p>Sludgy doom metal with shoegaze vocals. Not bad but not that good either.</p>

<p><img src="https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3181089603_10.jpg" /></p>

<p><img src="https://yuebeifan.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/9m88.jpg?w=1050&amp;h=" /></p>
<p>The band is killing it. 9m88 isn’t. I guess having a very spectacular crew of musicians to accompany an artist does have one drawback: it would be very easy to tell if the artist isn’t as good as their hired musicians. If there ever is an instrumental version of this I’d definitely get a copy. 9m88 本人蠻平庸的，樂手老師倒是真的很強</p>

<p><img src="https://new-transcendence.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Indark2.jpg" /></p>

<h2 id="老王樂隊---吾日三省吾身">老王樂隊 - 吾日三省吾身</h2>
<p><img src="https://i.kfs.io/album/global/64220449,0v1/fit/500x500.jpg" /></p>
<p>I don’t like this album at all… I tried not to be overly skeptical and went through the entire album, but I couldn’t help finding a lot of faults on this thing. The more rock oriented songs on this album sound like poorly done 80’s hard rock with cringeworthy guitar solos, and then there are folky slower songs, which probably were intended to appeal to a wider audience but just ended up sounding pretty cheesy and bland. One of the lowlights has got to be the vocals. I have a feeling that the vocalist was trying to showcase the versatility of his vocal abilities, but in the end it only made the songs even more insufferable. And it’s not even that difficult to figure that the lyrics are just as embarrassing as all the other aspects of the album… 破產版昏鴉</p>

<p>Organic Japanese ambient music. Not sure if people actually call this kind of music “environmental ambient”… The artist incorporated many different percussion elements into this album, there’s even a song when he’s hitting the water and the little pebbles. Very interesting record and definitely recommended for those who like Japanese new age music.</p>

<p>Another Japanese new age record from before I was born, this one has some cuts that sound darker and more bizarre, which is nice.</p>
<p>Release date: 2018-01-10</p>

<p>The best comparison would be Jack Rose / Pelt. Prominent eastern psychedelic sound influences blended with weird Americana guitars. Like a dream when you know you’re not entirely awake but couldn’t tell if you’re really dreaming. Good stuff.</p>
<p>Release date: 2005-01-01</p>

<p>Psyched-out ambient. I prefer Music For Airports’ sound to this one, but it’s still a pretty decent album nonetheless.</p>
<p>Release date: 2019-05-24</p>
<p>[7.9/10]</p>

<p><img src="https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a4122068721_10.jpg" /></p>
<p>Dark modern classical / ambient. Pretty mesmerizing. The song Above Chandeliers has a melody in the beginning of it that reminds me of the Windows XP startup sound.</p>
<p>Release date: 2017-11-03</p>
<p>[7.9/10]</p>
<h2 id="guzz---an-elephant-in-the-jungle">Guzz - An Elephant In The Jungle</h2>
<p><img src="https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0839264384_10.jpg" /></p>
<p>Bassy electronica with a lot of traditional instruments from the tropics. The title is actually quite fitting.</p>
<p>Release date: 2016-10-30</p>
<p>[7.8/10]</p>
<h2 id="jesus-piece---only-self">Jesus Piece - Only Self</h2>
<p><img src="https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2985474853_10.jpg" /></p>
<p>Slamming metalcore. Nice…</p>
<p>Release date: 2018-08-24</p>
<p>[7.6/10]</p>
<h2 id="joseph-nothing---dreamland-idle-orchestra">Joseph Nothing - Dreamland Idle Orchestra</h2>

<p>Hard to imagine how Tatsuda Yoshiya always strives to try new stuff and then does it well. This album is from his own IDM project, while there are some songs that I feel are a bit too hyperactive, it is overall still a pretty neat album that perfectly incorporates some elements from Tatsuda’s other musical projects, like funky slapped bass samples, proggy vocal samples and drum beats into a more choppy, Aphex Twin-ish electronica sound.</p>
<p>Release date:</p>
<p>[7.4/10]</p>
<h2 id="mark-pritchard---lock-off">Mark Pritchard - Lock Off</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.residentadvisor.net/images/reviews/2013/warprecords-349.jpg" /></p>
<p>Jungle / hip hop. Danceable but doesn’t really make a lot of impression.</p>
<p>Release date: 2020-05-20</p>
<p>[7.2/10]</p>
<h2 id="wiardon---windbreaker-music">Wiardon - Windbreaker Music</h2>
<p><img src="https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0738780898_10.jpg" /></p>
<p>Delicate but forgettable instrumental hip hop mini album at just 18 minutes of playing time. I enjoy the beats but they’re just too underdeveloped to be remembered. Hopefully the artist can translate the ideas explored on the album into more developed songs in their future projects.</p>
<p>Release date:</p>
<p>[7.0/10]</p>
<h2 id="courtney-marie-andrews---may-your-kindness-remain">Courtney Marie Andrews - May Your Kindness Remain</h2>
<p><img src="https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a4286792715_10.jpg" /></p>
<p>Sweet sounding country / americana album. I like her voice and the songwritings are pretty decent, but none of the songs actually stands out, at least to me.</p>
<p>Release date: 2018-03-23</p>
